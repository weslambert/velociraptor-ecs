ECS Mappings for Velociraptor artifacts...in progess!

These are a first attempt at defining ECS-compliant mappings for the native artifact output supplied by Velocidex Velociraptor.

Please keep in mind, this is a work in progress, and new artifact mappings will be added/updated frequently.

Feedback and contributions are welcome!
